# Introduction

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

Docker enables developers to separate the applications from the infrastructure and setup a clean environment for it.

# Container v.s VM

Docker use a technology called "container" to separate the applications from the infrastructure.

Besides container, another technology called virtual machine (VM) can also accomplish this.

The differences are that VM fully create an independent machine with independent OS, library, etc., and container creates a "container" based on OS of infrastructure server.

Therefore
- Container is faster and more lightweight than VM.
- VM is safer than container.
- Container is more reusable than VM.

<!--

Container is more reusable since it uses image, we will talk about later.

# How It Works

We need an "image" to create a container.

An image is a template containing the library, config, etc. for the applications.

Images are in "repository", and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) plays the role similar to GitHub.

Developers can develop their own images and push them to Docker Hub, and they can also use others images.

For example, if we want to build a load balancer with Nginx, we can use [Nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).

Every image has a name, besides,

# Preparation

Before starting using Docker, we have to do some preparation first.

- Install it.

  `$ sudo apt install docker.io`

- Check whether Docker is running.

  `$ sudo service docker status`

---

# Starting to Use Docker

After installation, we can now use Docker to create container.

- Run the first Docker container with `hello-world` image.

  `$ sudo docker run hello-world`

- Check container status.

  `$ sudo docker ps -a`

- Remove the container.

  `$ sudo docker rm [container name or container id]`

<!--

- `docker run` command will check whether the image is in local storage. If not, it will fetch the image from Docker Hub.

  It will automatically give the contain a name and print its id.

  Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally` means it cannot find it locally, and `latest: Pulling from library/hello-world` means it fetches it from remote repo.

- `-a` will show all containers, while no `-a` will only show active ones.

-->

---

# Starting to Use Docker

- Check the logs.

  `$ sudo docker logs [container name or container id]`

- Show the images stored in local repository.

  `$ sudo docker images`

<!--

- You can see `hello-world` image with tag `latest`.

[hello-world image](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world)

-->

---

# Starting to Use Docker

`docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARGS]`

Options
- `-d` or `--detach` - Run container in background and print container ID
- `--name` - Set container's name
- `--rm` - Automatically remove the container after it exits
- `-p [IP]:[CONTAINER PORT]:[HOST PORT]/[PROTOCOL]` - Publish a container's port(s) to the host, for example, `127.0.0.1:80:8080/tcp` expose `80` port on container to `8080` port on host
- `-it` - Allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin
- `--read-only` - Mount the container's root filesystem as read only

<!--

Let's check out some `docker run` usage.

`-i` and `-t` are two different options, and we can enter the container and run some commands by combining them.

-->

---

# Starting to Use Docker

We can also give some commands to container by using `docker run`.

For example

- `$ sudo docker run ubuntu bash` can create an container with ubuntu image and start a bash session.
- `$ sudo docker run ubuntu touch /root/test.txt` can create a file called `test.txt` after the container is created.

---

# Starting to Use Docker

`docker exec` can run a command in a running container.

1. `$ sudo docker run --name my_ubuntu -d -it ubuntu` - Create an ubuntu container.
2. `$ sudo docker exec -it my_ubuntu bash` - Enter the ubuntu container with bash.

<!--

Notice the `-it`.

Demo the whole section.
