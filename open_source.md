# What Is Open Source

An open source software means the software's source code is freely available to the public.

It can be modified and distributed by anyone.

However, open source does NOT mean free.

An open source software may have its own "license", it can restrict what you can do to the source code.

Without license, the software may be used for malicious purposes.

# License

GUN GPL (GNU General Public License) is a license like "virus". 

It allows others to distribute, copy, modify source code, but it asks others to use GPL as well. It affects all the other projects that used a project with GPL.

Even though you just use one line of GPL code, you should apply this license to your project as well.

That is, you have to make your project open source and everyone can use your project freely.

But GPL has many versions
