# Relational and Non-relational Database

There are two types of database, one is relational and the other one is non-relational.

- Relational Database (also called Relational Database Management System, RDBMS, or SQL)
  - It stores data in tables. The data in tables and rows is called as records.
  - It is structured and confined in format.
  - The data is easy to navigate.
  - Some popular examples: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL
