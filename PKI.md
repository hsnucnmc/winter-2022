# What Is PKI

PKI, standing for Public Key Infrastructure, consists of hardware, software, people, policies and so on.

It is used to create, manage, distribute, use, store, revoke digital certificates.

# What Is PKI

::left::

- Certificate - Signed by CA, it contains data of owner.
- CSR - Certificate Signing Request, sent by user who wants CA to sign a certificate for him or her.
- CA - Certificate Authority, it is itself a certificate.
- RCA - Root Certificate Authority, it only signs CA (including itself), not users. All the other CAs which are not RCA are called Intermediate CA.
- X.509 - An ITU standard defining the format of public key certificate.
- Chain of Trust - A hierarchy of certificates which is used to verify the validity of a certificateâ€™s issuer, and it consists of a trust anchor, at least one intermediate CA and end-entity certificate.

# What Is PKI

How to get a certificate from CA.

![](/ca-diagram.png)

<!--

From https://www.ssl.com/faqs/what-is-a-certificate-authority/

1. User use his own information and public key to generate CSR, and send it to CA

2. CA validates the information

3. Generate signed certificate with CA private key and send it back

# OpenSSL

> The OpenSSL Project develops and maintains the OpenSSL software - a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication.
>
> OpenSSL official page

The toolkit is versatile, we will use it to generate certificates and do server testing.

# OpenSSL - Create a Self-signed Certificate

There are many ways to get a certificate.
- Buy one
  - Expensive
- Get one from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/zh-tw/) with [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).
  - Free
  - Should be renewed every two months
- Sign one by yourself
  - Free
  - Expiration date is up to you
  - No one trust it

<!--

We will talk about the last method.

When talking about that, we will see how CA signs certificate.

-->

---

# OpenSSL - Create a Self-signed Certificate

You can use `openssl` command to generate key and certificate.

`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 30`
- `req` - PKCS#10 X.509 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Management.
- `-x509` - Output a x509 structure instead of a cert request.
- `-newkey` - Specify as type:bits (create a 4096 bits RSA key).
- `-sha256` - Use SHA256 to make output.
- `-nodes` - Do not encrypt key.
- `-keyout` - The output key file.
- `-out` - The output certificate file.
- `-days` - Number of days cert is valid for.

<!--

Method 1

Then you will be asked some questions about you.

After doing that, you will get a certificate file `cert.pem` and a key file `key.pem`, and you can use them in your service such as web server and mail server.

-->

---

# OpenSSL - Create a Self-signed Certificate

In addition to only generating key and certificate, you can create your own CA and use it to sign more certificates.


1.  Generate CA key (`-des3` allows you to use a password to protect your CA key).

    `$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096`

2.  Create CA cert by key.pem

    `$ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 365 -out ca.crt`

3.  Generate host key.

    `$ openssl genrsa -out host.key 4096`

<!--

Method 2

-->

---

# OpenSSL - Create a Self-signed Certificate

4. `openssl req -new -key host.key -sha256 -out host.csr`

    Use the host key to generate CSR.
5. `openssl x509 -req -in host.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out host.crt -days 30 -sha256`

    Use the CSR to create certificate.
    - `-CA` - Set the CA certificate, must be PEM format.
    - `-CAkey` - The CA key, must be PEM format; if not in CAfile.
    - `-CAcreateserial` - Create serial number file if it does not exist (`-CAserial` will be used for future use), this will yield a SRL file.
    - `-in` - The CSR file.
    - `-out` - The output certificate file.

<!--

Method 2

Actually the method is not reasonable.

CSR exists since user don't want to send private key to CA, but in this case, CSR and CA on the same host.

-->

# OpenSSL - Create a Self-signed Certificate

The first method is easy and convenient, while the second method is rather complicated.

However, if we need to generate a lot of certificates, you only need to install the CA to trust all the certificates by using the second method.

# OpenSSL - Test Server With OpenSSL

OpenSSL library also provides a command to connect to server with SSL/TLS.

We will take a mail server as example.

Mail server use SMTP, and we can make it secure by using SMTPS, which uses port 465.

For the former protocol, we can use `telnet` command to connect to the server, and for the latter protocol, we can use `openssl` command.

<!--

More details about mail server will be discussed later.

-->

---

# OpenSSL - Test Server With OpenSSL

**Scenario:**

We have a mail server on host `sirius.cnmc.tw` with SMTPS using port 587.

However, it does not work correctly, so we want to connect to it and check what's happened.

We can use `openssl s_client -connect sirius.cnmc.tw:465` to connect to the server.

If the mail server SMTPS is working, you can see a message like `220 sirius.cnmc.tw ESMTP Postfix`, and then we can start debugging.

Besides `220` message, you will see some SSL/TLS information such as server certificate, TLS version and so on.

<!--

`220` is status code

`AUTH LOGIN` asks server to authenticate your identity, you can enter username and password which are encoded in base64 now
